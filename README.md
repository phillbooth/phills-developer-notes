# Phill's Developer Notes

This repository contains a collection of my personal coding standards, best practices, and developer notes. These documents serve as a living checklist for maintaining code quality, consistency, and security in my projects. They are also designed to be used as a reference when prompting AI/LLM coding assistants to ensure the generated code aligns with modern, high-quality standards.

## What's Inside?

*   **[`php.md`](./php.md):** General PHP coding standards, covering everything from code style (PSR-12) and modern language features (PHP 8.x) to security best practices and architectural principles like SOLID.

*   **`Laravel.md`:** Best practices specific to the Laravel framework, including MVC patterns, Eloquent ORM usage, security considerations, and testing strategies.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to:

1.  **Enforce Consistency:** Provide a single source of truth for coding standards across all my projects.
2.  **Guide AI/LLM Interaction:** Use the "Questions to Ask an AI/LLM" sections to steer code generation towards optimal, secure, and maintainable solutions.
3.  **Onboard Quickly:** Act as a quick reference guide for myself or collaborators on project standards.

These are *my* personal notes and reflect the standards I strive for. They are not intended to be a universal standard for all PHP/Laravel development but are shared publicly for reference.

## Contributing

While these are personal notes, I'm always open to suggestions for improvement! If you spot an error, have a suggestion for a better practice, or think something is missing, please feel free to open an issue.
